<h2>Shannon Lee</h2>
<p>
	Hi there! My name is Shannon and I'm currently a Senior studying computer science and business administration. I'm currently undergoing a product management internship and hope to work in either project management or software development in the future!
	I love spending my down time reading, or with friends. A fun fact about me is that I have a shiba inu named Loki and a grey tabby named Cutie, both of whom I love very much!

    <p>Hi! I'm Lindsey and am currently a 3rd year Applied Computing Technology student at Colorado State University. I am employed by CSU in the Library Technical Services where I assist in maintaining databases, various applications and websites used in the Library. Currently, I am also a Student Intern for an organization called Young Life, where I get to mentor and lead middle school girls.
        I enjoy being outside specifically in the mountains on a warm summer day, crafting, sewing, and being with friends!</p>

<h2>Freya LaLuna</h2>
<p> Hey! I'm Freya LaLuna, and I'm currently a junior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Ethnic Studies. I'm currently employed as a peer educator for the SEED office on campus, where I facilitate workshops on social identity, bias, and communication. 
I love reading, creative writing, baking, and long-distance running! I also have two kittens, Tom and Sasha - the former is a rescue, and the latter adopted me late last year. </p>

<h2>Arysa Flores</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Arysa Flores and I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in 
    Human-Centered Computing. I love to read, write, and listen to music while hanging out with my pet cat Pluto. She is four years old and is a little bit 
    grumpy for her age, but once she trusts you she is very sweet (most of the time)!
